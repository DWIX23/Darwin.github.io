                                                <br>
                                                Pageantry is often associated with surface-level appeal and glamour but there's more to it than meets the eye. Behind the dazzling makeup and stunning attire lies a journey of self-discovery, perseverance and passion.
                                                <br>
                                                <br>
                                                Mark Angelo San Juan, also known as MA, a BS Biology in Microbiology student, proves that he can shine the brightest as he is crowned as Mr. University-Morong 2023.
                                                <br>
                                                <br>
                                                As everyone gave their best shot, MA added something that became vital to his winning, and it was his heart.
                                                <br>
                                                <br>
                                                “I gave my heart into this journey, and my hundred percent effort towards the [pageant].”
                                                <br>
                                                <br>
                                                MA, as a biology student, discusses his support for environmental empowerment and how it has influenced his pageant career.
                                                <br>
                                                <br>
                                                "As a biology student, I have always known that our planet is in crisis," he said. "That's why I chose to be an advocate for environmental empowerment. Since we are experiencing a lot of environmental issues, I believe that my advocacy is very crucial in today's world to raise awareness about those issues and encourage everyone to take action to protect mother earth."
                                                <br>
                                                <br>
                                                MA’s passion for the environment began to blossom during his early years of education where he learned about the importance of preserving and conserving our natural resources. As he progressed in his studies, he realized that advocacy is not just about expressing your opinion but also taking action to make a difference.
                                                <br>
                                                <br>
                                                "When I joined the pageant, I saw it as an opportunity to amplify my advocacy and reach a wider audience. I wanted to use the platform to inspire people to take action no matter how small it may seem. And I'm grateful that I was able to do just that." He said.
                                                <br>
                                                <br>
                                                However, MA's journey to the crown was not an easy one. He recalls that one of the major struggles he had was criticism and scrutiny that he eventually faced during his journey to the contest. But despite of all those condemnations, he used them as opportunities to grow and did not let criticisms impede his spirit.
                                                <br>
                                                <br>
                                                "One of the major struggles that I faced during the pageant season was the criticism," he said. "Being a contestant for this pageant placed me in a competitive environment where I received a lot of criticism. But I took those criticisms constructively. Because I know that there is still room for improvement."
                                                <br>
                                                <br>
                                                On the other hand, MA was also passionate about other activities but he soon realized that his interests were changing. While he found this disheartening, MA embraced the change and saw it as an opportunity to explore new hobbies and passions.
                                                <br>
                                                <br>
                                                "I've just come to the realization that I no longer feel as passionately about my former activities. Despite the fact that I find this to be disheartening, I am aware that it is a normal aspect of life and that our interests might change over time." He said.  "I'm willing to try out new hobbies and interests as long as they push me in fresh ways and thrill me. In fact, I see this as a chance to expand my horizons and find new passions." He added.
                                                <br>
                                                <br>
                                                MA's story serves as an inspiration to those who may be facing challenges in their personal growth and development. His journey to the crown was more than just about charm and charisma but rather a celebration of his perseverance and self-discovery. It is evident that pageantry is more than just a contest of beauty and charm. It is a platform for personal growth, advocacy and social change. MA's inspiring story reminds that pageantry is like a diamond, on the surface we can see its splendid and alluring outlook but when you dig deeper behind all of it, it is the hard work, dedication, pressure and refinement that shape him that truly makes him shine.
